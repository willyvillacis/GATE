GATE Application

These simulations were made as part of a PhD thesis, which aims to simulate calibration and volumetric sources in order to comparate measures of the radiation detectors like GeHP, Fricke and Alanine. 

This work project in the future will be focused on improving the simulation through adapting radioactive sources with high acitivities.
